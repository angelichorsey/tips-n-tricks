# tips-n-tricks
Personally curated tips and tricks for programming languages and command line interfaces. Created for self reference and to share with others.

My goal is to providing information that reduces the initial setup and efficiency barriers that people encounter when first learning to program. My friends that I wanted to share this with are windows users and that is how this repo will present.
